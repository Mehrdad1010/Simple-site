Design a site that includes three pages, about us, contact us, and home (you can use bootstrap for design.) Consider a fixed menu for all pages so that you can move on all pages.
Design the content of about and contact pages as desired.
However, the home pages should contain 6 cards, each card containing a photo, title, summary description, and a link (continuation of content) at the end of each card, and selecting that link will lead to the desired page of that card.
